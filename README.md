###  Data cleaning and Preparation
---
Microsoft Excel and SQL were used for data cleaning tasks such as:
 -Handling missing values
 -Removing duplicates to ensure data integrity.
 -Standardizing data formats (e.g., date formats).
 -Transforming data types for consistency across the dataset.

I also applied some structured Query Language like

```Sql
   Select * from dbo.[[LITA Capstone_Customerdata]]]

   SELECT TOP 1 SubscriptionType, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS CustomerCount
FROM dbo.[[LITA Capstone_Customerdata]]]
GROUP BY SubscriptionType
ORDER BY CustomerCount DESC;

   SELECT SubscriptionType, 
       SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM dbo.[[LITA Capstone_Customerdata]]]
GROUP BY SubscriptionType;

   SELECT 
    Canceled, 
    COUNT(*) AS TotalSubscriptions
FROM 
    dbo.[[LITA Capstone_Customerdata]]]
GROUP BY 
    Canceled;
```

###  Exploratory Data Analysis
---
This was done using Microsoft Excel and SQL to answer some salient questions needful for proper analysis. Important questions like

 o Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
 o Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular 
   subscription types.
 o Create any other interesting report

 o retrieve the total number of customers from each region.
 
 o find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.
 
 o find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.
 
 o calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.
 
 o find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
 
 o calculate total revenue by subscription type.
 
 o find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations. 
 
 o find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.
