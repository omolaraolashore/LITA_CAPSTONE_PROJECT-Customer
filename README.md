###  Data cleaning and Preparation
---
Microsoft Excel and SQL were used for data cleaning tasks such as:
  1. **Handling missing values
  2. **Removing duplicates to ensure data integrity.
  3. **Standardizing data formats (e.g., date formats).
  4. **Transforming data types for consistency across the dataset.

I also applied some structured Query Language like

```Sql
   Select * from dbo.[[LITA Capstone_Customerdata]]]
```
```sql
   SELECT TOP 1 SubscriptionType, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS CustomerCount
FROM dbo.[[LITA Capstone_Customerdata]]]
GROUP BY SubscriptionType
ORDER BY CustomerCount DESC;
```
```sql
   SELECT SubscriptionType, 
       SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM dbo.[[LITA Capstone_Customerdata]]]
GROUP BY SubscriptionType;
```
```sql
   SELECT 
    Canceled, 
    COUNT(*) AS TotalSubscriptions
FROM 
    dbo.[[LITA Capstone_Customerdata]]]
GROUP BY 
    Canceled;
```

###  Exploratory Data Analysis
---
This was done using Microsoft Excel and SQL to answer some salient questions needful for proper analysis. Important questions like

 1.  Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
   
 2.  Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular subscription types.

 3.  retrieve the total number of customers from each region.
 
 4.  find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.
 
 5.  find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.
 
 6.  calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.
 
 7.  find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
 
 8.  calculate total revenue by subscription type.
 
 9.  find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations. 
 
 10. find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.

### Key Findings
---
  -  The Basic Subscription Type is the most Popular among Customers having 16,921 Transaction IDs.It Generates the most revenue for the company
     since 50% of their revenue comes the Basic Subscription.Basic subscription is common in the East and The North.

  -  There are 20 distinct customers and they are evenly spreaded across the regions.The average Suscription duration for all customers is 365 days.
